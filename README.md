# Diabetes Detection Neural Network

Welcome to the Diabetes Detection Neural Network project! This project aims to utilize artificial intelligence techniques to aid in the early detection of diabetes. By analyzing various health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other relevant factors, our neural network model predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes.

## Features:
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate prediction.
- Input various health parameters for personalized risk assessment.
- Provides easy-to-understand results for proactive health management.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main program and input your health parameters.
4. Receive the prediction for diabetes risk.

## Contributions:
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the functionality and performance of our diabetes detection system. Whether it's improving the neural network model, adding new features, or fixing bugs, your contributions are valuable in advancing healthcare technology.
